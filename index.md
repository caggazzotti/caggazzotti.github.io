## Current research

As an Associate Research Scientist at the Human Language Technology Center of Excellence at Johns Hopkins University, I develop methods for authorship attribution (who wrote something) and speaker attribution from speech transcripts (who said something), both of which examine how someone's use of language can reveal (or protect) their identity. I am specifically interested in robust and explainable attribution models that work well in the challenging forensic linguistics setting, which involves minimal and often noisy data and requires higher standards for accuracy given the high-stakes consequences.

## Background
During my postdocs working with [Nicholas Andrews](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~noa/) at JHU and [Elizabeth Allyn Smith](https://eallynsmith.wordpress.com/) at the Université du Québec `a Montréal, we created a new benchmark and established the state of the art for speaker attribution by applying authorship attribution methods to conversational speech transcripts ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07564), [code](https://github.com/caggazzotti/speech-attribution)).  

I received my Ph.D. in Linguistics from Harvard University, advised by [Stuart Shieber](https://stuartshieber.com/). My [dissertation](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/42106941) created the first analysis of reciprocals in the formalism of synchronous tree adjoining grammar (STAG), unified this analysis with a parallel one of reflexives, and extended the formalism for the first time to encompass morphology.

I did an M.S. in Cognitive and Decision Sciences at University College London, advised by [David Lagnado](https://causalcognitionlab.com/dave/). My master's dissertation combined script theory and causal Bayesian networks to create a formalized crime script for cash-in-transit robbery that could ultimately be used by the police to identify effective prevention strategies.

I also hold a B.A. in Applied and Computational Mathematics and a B.A. in Linguistics from the University of Southern California. Fight on!

Interested in a little bit of everything, I love [traveling](/files/My_Travels_March2024.png) the world by sailboat/train/plane/bus/motorcycle/car, connecting with people, learning new skills, and working out. One of my favorite trips was sailing across the Pacific Ocean on a 34-foot sailboat with two other women ([S/V Islander](https://www.islandercirclestheworld.com/about)).
