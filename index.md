## Research Interests




## Background
I received my Ph.D. (and an M.A.) in Linguistics from Harvard, working with [Stuart Shieber](https://stuartshieber.com/). My dissertation created the first analysis of reciprocals in the formalism of synchronous tree adjoining grammar (STAG), unified with a parallel analysis of reflexives, and extended the formalism for the first time to encompass morphology.

I did an M.S. in Cognitive and Decision Sciences at University College London, working with David Lagnado. My master's dissertation combined script theory and causal Bayesian networks to create a formalized crime script for cash-in-transit robbery that could ultimately be used by the police to identify effective prevention strategies.
I also hold a B.A. in Applied and Computational Mathematics and a B.A. in Linguistics from the University of Southern California. 

Interested in a little bit of everything, I love traveling the world by sailboat, train, plane, bus, motorcycle, or car, connecting with people, acquiring new skills, working out, and partaking in adrenaline activities. One of my favorite trips was sailing across the Pacific Ocean on a 34-foot sailboat with two other women ([S/V Islander](https://www.islandercirclestheworld.com/about)).
